MedIntel - The Ultimate Healthcare Assistant 🚀💊

MedIntel is an AI-driven healthcare assistant designed to streamline prescription verification and assist in disease diagnosis. It automates prescription matching against medical databases and analyzes medical images & symptoms for accurate diagnoses.

📌 Features

🏥 Prescription Matching: Uses OCR to extract handwritten prescription details and cross-checks them against a verified drug database.

🦰 AI Diagnostic Assistant: Analyzes medical images (X-rays, MRIs, etc.) and patient symptoms to assist doctors in disease detection.

🔬 Drug Interaction & Allergy Detection: Identifies potential medication risks based on a patient's allergy history.

🌐 Scalable & Secure: Built with Flask, React, and SQLAlchemy, ensuring HIPAA/GDPR compliance.
